# Transforming Digital Visibility into Prosocial Action: The Scientific Value of "Cry / Клич"

## Abstract

The digital age has amplified our exposure to global suffering, yet this visibility rarely translates into sustained prosocial action. This paper introduces "Cry / Клич," a digital platform designed to bridge this gap by enabling micro-donations and community support. Grounded in behavioral science, ethics, and human-computer interaction (HCI), the project explores how technology can habitualize altruism in the context of the "noosphere"—Vladimir Vernadsky’s concept of a unified sphere of human thought. By integrating intuitive design, open statistics, and AI-driven validation, "Cry / Клич" offers a novel case study for understanding digital altruism’s mechanisms and impacts. This paper outlines the project’s methodology, anticipated findings, and contributions to interdisciplinary science, positioning it as a foundation for advancing knowledge in ethical technology and social behavior.

## 1. Introduction

In an era of hyperconnectivity, the constant visibility of others’ suffering—via social media, news, or crowdfunding platforms—presents a paradox: awareness is ubiquitous, but action remains sporadic. This disconnect raises critical questions for science and society: Why does visibility not reliably spur altruism? Can technology reshape ethical behavior in the digital age? The "Cry / Клич" project addresses these questions by creating a platform that transforms empathy into habitual, low-friction action.

"Cry / Клич" is rooted in the philosophical concept of the "noosphere" (Vernadsky, 1945), which envisions a collective human consciousness enabled by shared knowledge and technology. The project proposes a "new human" ethic, where digital tools make prosocial behavior a moral and practical norm. This paper examines the scientific value of "Cry / Клич" as an experimental platform, contributing to behavioral science, ethics, HCI, and data science. Below, we review relevant literature, detail the project’s methodology, anticipate results, and discuss its broader implications.

## 2. Literature Review

The scientific foundation of "Cry / Клич" draws on several research domains:

### 2.1 Behavioral Science and Altruism

Prosocial behavior is driven by empathy (Batson, 1991), social norms (Berkowitz, 1972), and ease of action (Latane & Darley, 1970). However, digital contexts introduce barriers like information overload and psychic numbing (Slovic, 2007), where exposure to mass suffering paralyzes rather than motivates. "Cry / Клич" tests whether reducing friction—via one-click micro-donations—can overcome these obstacles, aligning with research on nudge theory (Thaler & Sunstein, 2008).

### 2.2 Ethics and the Noosphere

Vernadsky’s noosphere (1945) and Teilhard de Chardin’s (1955) collective consciousness frame technology as a moral unifier. Yet, ethical challenges persist: Does digital visibility expand our duty to act? The project engages this debate by operationalizing a "new human" ethic, where inaction in the face of visible need becomes untenable, extending traditional ethical frameworks (Singer, 1972).

### 2.3 Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

HCI research underscores design’s role in shaping behavior (Norman, 1988). Persuasive technologies (Fogg, 2003) use cues like simplicity and feedback to encourage action. "Cry / Клич" applies these principles through intuitive interfaces and transparent statistics, testing their efficacy in fostering ethical engagement.

### 2.4 Social Network Dynamics

Diffusion of prosocial norms in digital networks (Centola, 2010) suggests that visible generosity can inspire others. The platform’s open data on user activity could create feedback loops, amplifying altruism—a hypothesis grounded in social proof theory (Cialdini, 2001).

## 3. Methodology

"Cry / Клич" is a digital platform that enables users to post "cries" for help and respond with support. Its design integrates interdisciplinary insights:

- **Micro-donations via Likes**: Users donate small, fixed amounts (e.g., 10-100 RUB) with one click, minimizing effort and leveraging behavioral economics.
- **AI and Human Validation**: A hybrid system uses machine learning to flag dubious requests, supplemented by human moderators to ensure trust—a critical factor in prosocial platforms (Kraft-Todd et al., 2018).
- **Open Statistics**: Public metrics (e.g., top donors, urgent needs) promote transparency and social incentives.
- **Categorization**: Users filter cries by type (e.g., "Medical Aid"), enhancing relevance and engagement.

The platform serves as a controlled environment to study digital altruism, with data collected via user analytics, surveys, and network analysis tools. This methodology tests hypotheses about friction, trust, and network effects in prosocial behavior.

## 4. Anticipated Results

Though still in development, "Cry / Клич" is expected to yield measurable outcomes:

- **Behavioral Shifts**: Lowering action barriers should increase donation frequency, consistent with studies on ease and altruism (Latane & Darley, 1970).
- **Network Effects**: Influential users may emerge as "altruism hubs," amplifying support—a pattern observed in online networks (Centola, 2010).
- **Ethical Evolution**: Surveys may reveal heightened moral awareness, supporting the "new human" hypothesis.
- **Social Insights**: Data on cry categories will highlight unmet needs (e.g., healthcare gaps), offering real-time societal diagnostics.

These findings will be quantified through donation rates, network maps, and qualitative feedback, providing a robust evidence base.

## 5. Discussion

"Cry / Клич" offers significant scientific value across multiple fields:

### 5.1 Advancing Behavioral Science

By testing digital nudges in a real-world setting, the project addresses gaps in understanding online altruism. It explores whether habitual action can counter desensitization (Slovic, 2007), contributing empirical data to a theoretical debate.

### 5.2 Ethical Innovation

The platform operationalizes the noosphere as a moral framework, asking: Can technology make empathy actionable at scale? This aligns with calls for a "digital ethics" that adapts to modern challenges (Floridi, 2014).

### 5.3 HCI and Design

Success or failure will inform persuasive technology design, particularly how transparency and simplicity influence ethical behavior—key questions in HCI (Fogg, 2003).

### 5.4 Social and Policy Implications

Open data on needs could guide resource allocation, offering a decentralized alternative to traditional welfare models. This has practical value for policymakers and NGOs.

### 5.5 Limitations

Risks include commodification of help (e.g., reducing altruism to transactions) and social pressure from visible statistics. These challenges require iterative refinement and ethical oversight.

## 6. Conclusion

"Cry / Клич" is a pioneering experiment at the nexus of technology, ethics, and social science. By transforming digital visibility into prosocial action, it tests the boundaries of altruism in the noosphere and lays a scientific foundation for understanding the "new human." Its interdisciplinary contributions—spanning behavioral insights, ethical theory, HCI, and social dynamics—make it a valuable case study for future research. Next steps include piloting the platform, analyzing long-term impacts, and exploring cross-cultural scalability. Through this work, "Cry / Клич" not only addresses a pressing societal problem but also advances our scientific grasp of digital morality.
